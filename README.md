# openSUSE-xfce icon theme

This is not a full icon theme but rather an add-on for Adwaita fixing missing icons that are used in Xfce but missing in Adwaita upstream. Icons used are either from Adwaita upstream or not affiliated projects.

## Installation

Clone this repository and place the content in $HOME/.local/icons or /usr/share/icons
